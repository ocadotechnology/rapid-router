Please make sure that you give us a suitable level of detail about the feature. Please label it as a "suggestion". Please note that we may not act upon all suggestions, if they are not in line with the direction we want to take the project, or if we don't have the development resource to get it done.

__Want to help develop?__ Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/ocargo/issues) for the tasks we'd like to implement. The [issues with the volunteer label](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/ocargo/labels/volunteer) are tasks we think are ready to be picked up. Once you have chosen an issue, make sure you assign it to yourself so others don't also pick it up. Develop it on your fork of the project. Once you are happy that it works, and have written tests for it, submit a pull request. We'll then look to review the changes. If it looks good, we'll merge it. If we find issues with it, we'll let you know and hopefully we can work with you to improve it and get it re-submitted. If it is a change that we just don't want, we'll reject it.

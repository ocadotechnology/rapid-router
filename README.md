Rapid Router is a 'Code For Life' project, aimed at teaching children programming concepts through a vehicle routing
game.

## To use the app
Go to the official [Code For Life website][c4l].

## To run the app locally

* Install prerequisites. E.g. on Ubuntu / Linux Mint:
    * `sudo apt-get install git`
    * `sudo apt-get install virtualenvwrapper`
    * `sudo apt-get install python-dev`
    * `sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev`
    * `sudo apt-get install ruby2.0` - still Ruby 1.9 hiding under `ruby` command.
    * `sudo gem install sass -v 3.3.4` - later versions incompatible with Ruby 1.9 (see above).

* Clone the repo: `https://github.com/ocadotechnology/rapid-router.git`
* Make and activate a virtualenv
    * e.g. the first time, `mkvirtualenv -a path/to/rapid-router rapid-router`
    * and thereafter `workon rapid-router`
* `./run` in your rapid-router directory - This will:
    * install all of the dependencies using pip
    * sync the database
    * collect the static files
    * run the server
* Once you see `Quit the server with CONTROL-C`, you can open the portal in your browser at `localhost:8000`.

* If you have problems seeing the portal on machines with different locale (e.g. Polish), check the terminal for errors mentioning `ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8`. If you see them, you need to have environment variables `LANG` and `LC_ALL` both set to `en_US.UTF-8`.
    * Either export them in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`
    * or restart the portal with command `LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 ./run`.

## Localisation
* `./run --with-translation-tools` in your rapid-router dir to include the translation/localisation libraries
* You will need your crowdin api key locally in the `CROWDIN_API_KEY` environment variable, e.g. `export CROWDIN_API_KEY=<key>`. This can be obtained from [the settings page](https://crowdin.com/project/code-for-life/settings#integration)
* Set your `django_language` cookie to `lol-us` to enable in-context localisation

## To contribute
__Found a problem? Please check whether it has already been reported in our [issue tracker][issues] first!__ If not,
[add it][add-issue]. Please make sure that you give us a suitable level of detail about the symptoms and how to
reproduce it. Please label it as a "bug".

__Want to suggest a feature? Please check whether it has already been added to our [issue tracker][issues] first!__ if
not, [add it][add-issue]. Please make sure that you give us a suitable level of detail about the feature. Please label
it as a "suggestion". Please note that we may not act upon all suggestions, if they are not in line with the direction
we want to take the project, or if we don't have the development resources to get it done.

__Want to help develop?__ Check out the [issue tracker][issues] for the tasks we'd like to implement. The
[issues with the 'ready for pickup' label][ready-for-pickup] are tasks we think are ready to be picked up. Once you have
chosen an issue, make sure you assign it to yourself so others don't also pick it up. Develop it on your fork of the
project. Please ensure all files have the license at the top (see another source file for an example). Once you are
happy that it works, and have written tests for it, submit a pull request. We'll then look to review the changes. If it
looks good, we'll merge it. If we find issues with it, we'll let you know and hopefully we can work with you to improve
it and get it re-submitted. If it is a change that we just don't want, we'll reject it.

## Rapid Router

[Code for Life](https://www.codeforlife.education/) has been developed by Ocado Technology as a **free, open-source** project to inspire the next generation of computer scientists and to help teachers deliver the computing curriculum.

**Rapid Router** is a [Code for Life](https://www.codeforlife.education/) project, primarily aimed at teaching primary school students programming concepts through a vehicle routing game (older students welcome). It starts with [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) and transitions to Python.

This repository hosts the source code of the **Rapid Router game**.

We are open to contributors from anywhere around the world. Please read ahead if you'd like to get involved.
